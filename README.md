        ```bash
        env\Scripts\activate
        ```
    - Unix
        ```bash
        source env/bin/activate
        ```

* ### Deactivate Environment
    And if you need to close it, then run as easy as run terminated signal:
    - Windows/Unix
        ```bash
        [CTRL + C]
        ```

    or you can close it in gracefully way:
    - Windows/Unix
        ```bash
        deactivate
        ```

## Usage

    1. Migrate all database
        ```sh
        python manage.py migrate
        ```
    2. After migrate, you should run ngrok to make public url

        ngrok http localhost:8000
        ```
    3. Copy the public url the one with **https** and put it as webhook URL in LINE Bot configuration.
    4. Run the application
        ```sh
        python manage.py runserver
        ```
    5. Exit by triggering a default terminate signal if you already done
        ```sh
        [CTRL + C]
        ```

    - Make migrations if you edit/create a model
        ```sh
        python manage.py makemigrations
        ```
    - Migrate the model changes you made in database
        ```sh
